            <info>Gandyld, an old mage living east of Aris, has given you his spare mana crystal. However, since the crystal is rather weak, he has suggested that you go check out his information about King Rhun's alchemists coming up with a concoction that could enhance mana crystals. King Rhun's domain is in the heart of Giant Mountains, and his outpost is at the very peak of the mountains. The concoction would likely be in a cauldron or a pool in their laboratory.</info>

                    <message>When a mage applies a mana crystal while he is full on mana, half of his mana will be transferred to the crystal. The mage can then apply the crystal at any time to get the mana back. Crystals have a maximum mana capacity, so mages are always after the ones that can hold the most.</message>

                    <message>Now, listen. I have heard that King Rhun's alchemists are trying to come up with a concoction that would enhance the mana limit of weak crystals, like the one I have just given you. It is strange to see giants coming up with magical enchantments, so it may not even work, or maybe explode on contact with the crystal. However, feel free to go and check it out, but if you do and it works, please come back so I can examine the crystal.</message>
                    <message>The heart of the Giant Mountains, just north of here, is King Rhun's domain. He has an outpost of sorts at the very peak of the mountains, where it is so cold most don't even dare approach. The concoction is likely to be in a cauldron or a pool in their laboratory. Be careful.</message>

                    <message>Very well... Seeing that their enchantment works, it is rather worrying. Maybe the giants are becoming intelligent? Hm... King Rhun is rather intelligent for a giant, and likes to experiment with alchemy and some magic, but most other giants? Very strange indeed.</message>
                    <message>At any rate, this seems like the sort of thing King Rhun would be interested in experimenting with, making it better. If you can find his concoction, you might be able to improve the crystal I have given you even further. I suggest trying to look for his vault or similar.</message>
