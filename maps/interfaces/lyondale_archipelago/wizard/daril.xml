            <message>He is the leader of the dragons on the Dragons Island. Apparently it's possible to get to Dragons Island by completing the Underground Maze under Promethia Island.</message>
            <message>I wouldn't go there if I were you, though. The maze is one thing, but those dragons were sealed on that island for a reason...</message>
            <message>At any rate, the smoking pipe is most likely not even there, anyway. It would be a waste of time to go looking for it there.</message>
