/**
 * @file
 * This is the order of the skills structure:
 *  char *name;
 *  short category;  - the associated experience category
 *  short time;      - the base number of ticks it takes to execute skill
 *  long  bexp;      - base exp gain for use of this skill
 *  float lexp;      - level multiplier for experience gain
 *  short stat1;     - primary stat, for linking to exp cat.
 *  short stat2;     - secondary stat ...
 *  short stat3;     - tertiary stat ...
 *
 * About time - this  number is the base for the use of the skill. Level
 * and associated stats can modify the amount of time to use the skill.
 * Time to use the skill is only used when 1) op is a player and
 * 2) the skill is called through do_skill().
 * It is strongly recommended that many skills *not* have a time value.
 *
 * About 'stats' and skill.category - a primary use for stats is determining
 * the associated experience category (see link_skills_to_exp () ).
 * Note that the ordering of the stats is important. Stat1 is the 'primary'
 * stat, stat2 the 'secondary' stat, etc. In this scheme the primary stat
 * is most important for determining the associated experience category.
 * If a skill has the primary stat set to NO_STAT_VAL then it defaults to a
 * 'miscellaneous skill'.
