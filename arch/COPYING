The Atrinik project uses images from various free sources. You can find
credits for the images in the LICENSE file in the image's directory, or
in the top level directory. The license_check.py script will scan all
LICENSE files and display the contributors.

The LICENSE files mention the project or the author where the image(s) in
question came from, and their usage terms/license. In many cases, this
can be difficult to track down, so if you find an image that is
incorrectly credited, please let us know immediately by emailing the
following address (replace " {AT} " with @):

 - admin {AT} atrinik.org
