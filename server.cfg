# values required for the server to start up correctly. Feel free to

# .cfg file and load it up with the --config command line option, in
# order to avoid accidentally committing changes to the default config,
# and to prevent needless merge conflicts in the future.

# Note that if running the server using the server.sh or server.bat script,
